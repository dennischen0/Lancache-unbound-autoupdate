# Lancache-Pihole

Straight to the point - I took the following guide (below) on how to set up Pihole to forward request to Lancache and turned it into a script. This will allow you to continue to use the Pihole web gui with the benefits of Lancache. 

Command to use this - 
  git clone https://github.com/Maddcow/Lancache-Pihole
  cd Lancache-Pihole
  chmod +x lancache-pihole.sh
  ./lancache-pihole.sh
